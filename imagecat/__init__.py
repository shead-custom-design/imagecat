    Virtually all non-trivial Imagecat operations have parameters that affect
    their operation.  Because individually creating parameter tasks and linking
    them with the main task is tiresome and verbose, use this function instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph: :class:`graphcat.Graph`, required
        The Graphcat graph where the new task will be created.
    name: :class:`str`, required
        The name of the new task.
    fn: callable, required
        The Imagecat operation to use for the new task.
    parameters: additional keyword arguments, optional
        Each extra keyword argument will be turned into a parameter
        task and linked with the main task.  Each parameter name
        is created by concatenating `name` with the keyword name,
        separated by a slash "/".

    Returns
    -------
    name: :class:`str`
        Name of the newly-created operation, which may be different than `name`.
