Installation
============

Using Pip
---------

Unless your package manager supports Imagecat, your default option for
installation should be Python setup tools like `pip`.  You can always install
the latest stable version of Imagecat and its required dependencies using::

    $ pip install imagecat

... following that, you'll be able to use all of Imagecat's features.

From Source
-----------

Finally, if you want to work with the latest, bleeding-edge Imagecat goodness,
you can install it using the source code::

    $ git clone https://github.com/shead-custom-design/imagecat
    $ cd imagecat
    $ sudo python setup.py install

The setup script installs Imagecat's required dependencies and copies Imagecat into
your Python site-packages directory, ready to go.
